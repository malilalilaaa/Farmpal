The agricultural app empowers farmers by integrating NASA data and advanced technologies to address key challenges.Upon launching the app, users are prompted to select their preferred language, ensuring accessibility for diverse communities.

They can then log in using their phone numbers, or register with an OTP-based system, utilizing Firebase authentication for security.

The app's dashboard is divided into two main sections: Explore and NASA Gallery. The Explore section offers seven key features: AgriSmart (crop recommendations), Flood Detection, Drought Detection, Irrigation Management, Disease Detection, a global Community for farmer communication, and an AI voice assistant named Xorina, which responds to voice commands. These tools help farmers predict natural disasters, optimize crop decisions, and seek expert advice.
The NASA Gallery section displays agriculture-related videos to enhance farmers' knowledge through visual content. This app focuses on connecting farmers to real-time data and expert guidance, enabling them to make informed decisions and increase resilience against environmental challenges.

AgriSmart: a crop recommendation system that retrieves location-based data such as temperature, humidity, soil pH, and rainfall from APIs. It then recommends four best-suited crops, which users can directly add to their profile under the "Your Crops" section.

Flood Detection: powered by a machine learning model for flood prediction, it retrieves real-time MODIS images (from the last two days via the Terra API) to show current conditions and provides a flood risk percentage. A drop-down menu offers four options: Shelter Cluster, Pre-flood Recovery, Post-flood Recovery, and Connect with Authority for emergency support.

Drought Detection: This feature analyzes data on soil moisture, temperature, and precipitation levels to predict the likelihood of droughts. It provides real-time updates, helping farmers plan irrigation schedules and mitigate the risk of crop failure due to water scarcity.
Irrigation Management: This tool leverages satellite data on groundwater storage and soil moisture to create optimized irrigation schedules. Farmers receive personalized recommendations for efficient water use, ensuring crops are well-hydrated while conserving water resources.


AI Voice Assistant Xorina: Xorina allows farmers to interact with the app via voice commands, making the app even more accessible. Whether it's getting crop recommendations, flood updates, or disease alerts, farmers can quickly access information hands-free, enhancing the user experience.


Global Community: A dedicated space where farmers can connect, share knowledge, and seek advice from fellow farmers and agricultural experts worldwide. The community fosters collaboration, offering support on various farming issues and innovations.
